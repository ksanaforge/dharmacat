	3:"Here and elsewhere, I adopt Pāli for proper names and doctrinal terms in order to facilitate comparison with the Pāli parallels, except for anglicised terms like Dharma and Nirvāṇa, without thereby intending to take a position on the original language of the Saṃyukta-āgama manuscript used for translation, which according to de Jong 1981: 108 would in fact have been Sanskrit."
	,4:"SN 22.12 at SN III 21,6 and SN 22.51 at SN III 51,11 do not give a full reference to the location or to the Buddha addressing the monks. Thus the E e edition of SN 22.12 reads evaṃ me sutaṃ, sāvatthiyaṃ tatra kho (as do B e and S e ), after which the discourse proper starts with rūpaṃ, bhikkhave, aniccaṃ, etc. In the case of C e the text has just sāvatthiyaṃ, i.e., without evaṃ me sutaṃ or tatra kho. The E e edition of SN 22.51 just reads sāvatthi, tatra voca, B e has sāvatthinidānaṃ, C e and S e just sāvatthiyaṃ. The full description given in SĀ 1, and thus at the outset of the Saṃyukta-āgama, is thus similar to the full reference given in the first discourse in the Saṃyutta-nikāya, SN 1.1 at SN I 1,1: evaṃ me sutam, ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. This suggests the brief reference to sāvatthiyaṃ or else at times to sāvatthi nidānaṃ to be simply an abbreviation and quite probably not a reference to the location where the discourses were collected, as suggested by Rhys Davids 1924/1975: xif and Woodward 1930: xviif; cf. also below note 45, note 88 and note 148."
