{2p1a0702-04|At that time} {2p1a0704-06|the Blessed One} said to the monks: "You should contemplate bodily form as impermanent. One who contemplates like this has right insight.{fn5} One who has right insight arouses disenchantment. One who has disenchantment eradicates delight and lust. One who eradicates delight and lust, I say, liberates the mind.{fn6}
In the same way contemplate feeling ... perception ... formations ... consciousness as impermanent. One who contemplates like this has right insight. {fn7} One who has right insight arouses disenchantment. One who has disenchantment eradicates delight and lust. One who eradicates delight and lust, I say, liberates the mind.
One who has liberated the mind in this way, monks, if he wishes to declare himself is able to declare of himself: {fn8} 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.'
(Just as with contemplating impermanence, in the same way also for dukkha, emptiness and not-self). {fn9}
Then the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully. {fn10}
